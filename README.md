# Hand-Gesture-Particle-System
Hand Gesture Particle System is a real-time WebGL project using Three.js and MediaPipe Hands. It renders 10,000 animated particles that morph into multiple 3D shapes based on hand gestures. Finger count, hand movement, and pinch gestures control shape, rotation, and scale interactively.
